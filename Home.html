    <p>Subsequently, Khenpo Jamyang Sherab, the abbot of Tharlam and a direct disciple of H.E. Dezhung Rinpoche, constructed a magnificent three-story tall copper-and-gold statue of the supreme refuge, Lord Buddha Shakyamuni, as the monastery’s central image. On either side of this statue, he erected two-story high copper-and-gold statues of Choje Sakya Paṇḍita and Ngorchen Dorjechang Kunga Zangpo. These statues, along with their structures, were crafted with great care and purity, reflecting the aspirations of his guru.

        H.E. Dezhung Jampa Kunga Tenpai Nyima gave many profound teachings on sutra, tantra, and Sanskrit grammar. In 1990, His Holiness Dagchen Jigdral Dorjechang bestowed the Lamdre empowerment for the first time outside Tibet at Tharlam Monastery. This empowerment was attended by thousands of students, including high lamas, monks, and lay practitioners.
        
        In 1993–1994, His Holiness Sakya Gongma Trichen Dorjechang visited Tharlam Monastery and gave teachings on Dubthab Kuntue, a collection of sadhanas in the Sakya tradition compiled by Loter Wangpo. In 1994, the fourth supreme reincarnation of Dezhung Rinpoche was enthroned at Tharlam Monastery. In 2007, His Holiness Dagchen Sakya Jigdral Dorjechang gave the extensive and profound teachings of the Lamdre Lobshe for the second time. Ngor Luding Khenchen Dorjechang, Gawa Ngawang Lekpa’s reincarnation Gonpo Sonam Choden, and other revered masters blessed the monastery with their teachings, further enriching the Mahayana Dharma tradition.
        
        Under the leadership of His Eminence Dezhung Rinpoche Ngawang Kunga Tegchen Chokyi Nyima Tenpai Gyaltsen, the monastery continues to uphold the practices of the previous holy masters. Guided by his wisdom and compassion, the monks and disciples engage in the three activities of teaching, practice, and service, ensuring the flourishing of the Dharma and the benefit of all beings.
